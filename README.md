â˜• Java Basics: An Introduction
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). Known for its platform independence, Java follows the "write once, run anywhere" philosophy thanks to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Java is widely used for developing:

1. Desktop applications

2. Web applications

3. Mobile apps (especially Android)

4. Enterprise software

5. Backend systems

ðŸ”‘ Key Features of Java

1. Simple & Familiar: Easy to learn, especially for those with C/C++ backgrounds.

2. Object-Oriented: Everything is treated as an object, supporting principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

3. Platform-Independent: Java code is compiled into bytecode, which runs on any device with a JVM.

4. Secure & Robust: Strong memory management and built-in security features.

5. Multithreaded: Built-in support for concurrent programming.

6. Rich API: Comes with extensive libraries for networking, data structures, I/O, and more.
